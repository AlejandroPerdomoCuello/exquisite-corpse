## The Killer Suikerwaffel

This is the story of the Killer Suikerwaffel, one of the most creative ways a single person decided to imitate Thanos and whipe half the population to help the earthlings.

And so the legendary story of **Mr. Killer Suikerwafel** began. He fought brave through whipped cream and marshmallows. And even saved the ~~beautiful~~ princess of The Great United Cherry Kingdoms. But his bravest act has yet to come...

He plunged himself in the fountain of dark chocolate :brown_heart: and absorbed as much chocolate as he could. He swelled up **5 times** his original weight. He felt super strong :muscle: and his mind turned dark as the chocolate.

He didn't want to see the princess with his dark mind. He went on a journey in search of white chocolate. On the way, he saw a pile of fresh creamy butter he couldn't resist and gobbled up a portion of that and fell asleep. Thus, Princess had no choice to accept Thanos proposal.
